# **About Me**

Hi, I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I hold a PhD in physics and currently work as a Senior Data Scientist and ML Engineer at 
Helicon Technologies. I love solving complex problems through 
technology. I am also an AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer Associate.

I enrolled in university at 16, showcasing a strong aptitude for learning and 
problem-solving. At 21, I moved to Sweden to pursue my PhD in Physics. Over the years, 
I’ve developed a strong technical expertise in machine learning with tools like
TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. Alongside this, I’ve honed my expertise in MLOps,
cloud computing, and ML engineering, utilizing platforms and tools like AWS, Docker, and MLFlow.
As a dedicated Linux user for over a decade, I bring extensive experience in Python-based 
development and version control with Git and GitHub/GitLab.

Beyond my technical skills, I excel at managing and leading both research and business 
projects. I’m autonomous, self-driven, and have a knack for planning and execution. With
fluency in French and English and advanced Japanese proficiency (JLPT N2), I enjoy 
collaborating in multicultural teams and thrive in dynamic environments. I’m mobile, 
adaptable, and always eager to take on new challenges, wherever they may lead.
