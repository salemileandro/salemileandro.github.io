# **About Me**

Hi, I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I hold a PhD in physics and am currently working as a Data Scientist and ML Engineer
for [Helicon Technologies](https://helicon.ai/).

I enrolled in university at 16, showcasing a strong aptitude for learning and 
problem-solving. At 21, I moved to Sweden to pursue my PhD. Over the years, 
I’ve developed a strong technical foundation in machine learning with tools like
Tensorflow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, alongside expertise in cloud and ML engineering 
with AWS, Docker and MLFlow. A dedicated Linux user for over a decade, I bring extensive
experience in Python-based development and version control with Git and GitHub/GitLab.

I thrive in managing and leading research and business projects, leveraging my autonomy, 
self-driven nature, and strong planning skills. Fluent in French and English, with 
advanced Japanese proficiency (JLPT N2), I love collaborating within multicultural 
teams. I’m mobile, adaptable, and excited about embracing new challenges, wherever they
may be.

Feel free to [contact me](/contact/) if you want to know more!
